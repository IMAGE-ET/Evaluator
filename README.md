#  Evaluator

## Summary

Evaluator is a complete CRUD app using Core Data to store persistent data.
It allow the user to create Bestiaries (list of Beasts) of only one type for now, since it was a PoC of core data. Once a bestiary is created, you can add a Beast entry.

## Designed usage

This app was first created to give deeper meaning to taunts in battle games. "I'll send you see the goddess" will be even funnier if said goddess just disrespect the loser after. If you are merciful, you can insert advices instead of taunts when creating a beast. Use '\t' characters (tabs) when filling the "advices" field to have a in-game dialogue box like experience.

## Build

Pull the project on a XCode machine and run it.
Requirements are Ios version 16+ because of the use of NavigationStack (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/migrating-to-new-navigation-types)
